# AssetFlow — Implementation Tracker

> **Purpose:** Single source of truth for tracking what each member has built, what is pending, and what is verified. Update this file every time a feature is completed or merged to `dev`.
>
> **Last Updated:** 2026-07-12 — Initial creation after verifying Member 1's PR merge.

- [x] Department model — headId, parentDepartmentId hierarchy, DepartmentStatus
- [x] User model — email, passwordHash, role, status, departmentId, all relations
- [x] AssetCategory model

- [x] All models use @@map() snake_case table names
- [x] Cascade / SetNull / Restrict delete rules defined
- [x] Migration done — Supabase DB created (commit fd6664c)

### DONE — Backend Auth Routes & Middleware

- [x] POST /auth/signup — create EMPLOYEE with bcrypt + JWT
- [x] POST /auth/login — verify credentials, reject INACTIVE users
- [x] POST /auth/forgot-password — log to console (demo mode)
- [x] GET /auth/me — return current user from JWT
- [x] auth.middleware.js — JWT verify → req.user
- [x] role.middleware.js — RBAC
- [x] validate.middleware.js — body validation
- [x] error.middleware.js — global error handler
- [x] department.routes.js — GET, POST, PATCH /departments
- [x] category.routes.js — GET, POST, PATCH /categories
- [x] user.routes.js — GET /users, PATCH /role, PATCH /status
- [x] server.js — Express entry point, CORS, route registration
- [x] config/prisma.js — Prisma client singleton
- [x] config/jwt.js — secret + expiry

### DONE — Frontend

- [x] Vite + React 18 + Tailwind CSS v4 + React Router v7 scaffold
- [x] vite.config.js — proxy /api → localhost:5000
- [x] src/index.css — Inter font, Tailwind import, base reset
- [x] src/api/authApi.js — Axios instance, base /api/v1, JWT interceptor
- [x] src/components/PasswordInput/PasswordInput.jsx — show/hide toggle
- [x] src/pages/Login/LoginPage.jsx — form, validation, role redirect

- [x] src/App.jsx — BrowserRouter with /login, /register, /dashboard routes

### PENDING — Frontend (Member 1)

- [ ] src/context/AuthContext.jsx — currentUser, login(), logout()
- [ ] src/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx — Sidebar + content shell
- [ ] src/pages/OrganizationSetup/ — Screen 3 (3 tabs: Departments, Categories, Employee Directory)
- [ ] Protected route wrapper — redirect unauth users to /login
- [ ] src/hooks/useAuth.js

### ISSUES FOUND

| # | Severity | Issue | Location | Action |
|---|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | ~~MUST FIX~~ FIXED | Password min-length was 6; SHARED_ENUMS.md specifies 8 | RegisterPage.jsx L21 | **Fixed** — changed to `< 8` |
| 2 | ~~MUST FIX~~ FIXED | JWT interceptor only read localStorage; sessionStorage tokens were ignored | authApi.js L18 | **Fixed** — interceptor now checks both |
| 3 | Medium | LoginPage stores JWT without calling AuthContext.login() — update once AuthContext is built | LoginPage.jsx L89–95 | Update after AuthContext is built |
| 4 | Low | RegisterPage redirects to /login after signup — WORKFLOW.md says Dashboard. Acceptable for demo. | RegisterPage.jsx L97 | Low priority |
| 5 | Low | App.css contains unused Vite boilerplate CSS (.hero, .ticks, etc.) | App.css | Cleanup |

## Integration Checkpoints

## Critical Path (Blockers)

> Fix these first — they block everyone else.

1. **[Member 1]** Build auth.middleware.js + role.middleware.js → unblocks Members 2 & 3 from protecting routes
2. **[Member 1]** Build DashboardLayout.jsx → unblocks Members 2, 3 & 4 from building inner pages
3. **[Member 4]** Deliver createLog() + createNotification() utilities → unblocks all controller side effects
4. **[FIXED]** ~~[Member 1] Fix password min-length in RegisterPage.jsx (6 → 8)~~
5. **[FIXED]** ~~[Member 1] Fix JWT interceptor in authApi.js to also check sessionStorage~~
